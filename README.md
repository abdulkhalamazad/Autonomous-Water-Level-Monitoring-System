# Autonomous-Water-Level-Monitoring-System
The Autonomous Water Level Monitoring System uses an ESP8266 and Blynk app to track water levels at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% via stainless steel probes. The system automatically controls a pump, turning it on below 25% and off at 100%. Users can monitor levels and manually control the pump remotely via the Blynk app for efficient water management.
